        Information technology (IT) is the use of any computers, storage, networking and other physical devices, infrastructure and processes to create, 
        process, store, secure and exchange all forms of electronic data.The commercial use of IT encompasses both computer 
        technology and telecommunications.</p>

    <p style="color: darkorchid;">We can never see two people of the same personality. It never changes and determines the quality of a person.I am very specific in this world and have a 
        unique personality compared to others. I am a very responsible and sympathetic person. I always help others and try my best to solve their problems. 
        I am self-centered, there is no enemy in this world.I always talk to others very happily with a smiling face. I am a very simple student in my school and 
        attend every class.</p>
        
    <p style="font-style: oblique;"> I do my homework very well on a daily basis and study well every day from 10 am to 4 am.I always pay attention to my studies and inspire my friends to 
        focus on my studies.</p>
